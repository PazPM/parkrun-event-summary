# parkrun Event Summary

## What is this?

This is a chrome extension that creates an infographic about the results from a particular parkrun.   The infographic is generated when you visit either the latest results page, or any historic results page served from parkrun.org.uk

e.g. If you want to see an infographic for the latest results from [Portsmouth Lakeside](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/portsmouthlakeside/results/latestresults/)) open that page and the infographic will be generated and added just under the header.

## Why does it exist?

I was inspired to create it when I saw a really cool infographic at my local parkrun, that was (I believe) based on a PowerPoint slide (that I think might have been) created by a Steve Tyler - there are many examples on the Rushmoor Parkrun results page.  The process of getting the data into Powerpoint is quite cumbersome, so I wanted to see if I could simplify it.

## Will it explode?

No.

Please note that this _is_ currently **alpha release** software - i.e. it may not work perfectly, _yet_.

## Can I help?

Quite probably!  Fork the repo, add stuff, send me a pull request. 

## Is this an official parkrun tool?

No.  This tool is not affiliated in any way with PARKRUN LIMITED who oversee parkrun events.
