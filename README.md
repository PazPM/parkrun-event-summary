# parkrun Event Summary

## What is this?

This is a chrome extension that creates an infographic about the results from a particular parkrun.   The infographic is generated when you visit either the latest results page, or any historic results page served from parkrun.org.uk

e.g. If you want to see an infographic for the latest results from [Portsmouth Lakeside](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/portsmouthlakeside/results/latestresults/)) open that page and the infographic will be generated and added just under the header.

## Why does it exist?

I was inspired to create it when I saw a really cool infographic at my local parkrun, that was generated using a PowerPoint slide (that I think might have been) created by Steve Tyler (for Rushmoor parkrun) that may in turn have been based on [a design](https://www.facebook.com/greatsalternsparkrun/photos/pb.100080505252730.-2207520000/181070371149452/?type=3) by Ian Gregory (an RD at Great Salterns) - there are many examples on the Rushmoor and Great Salterns Parkrun results pages.  The process of getting the data into Powerpoint is quite cumbersome, so I wanted to see if I could simplify it, thus a chrome extension that builds the whole image in-page automatically (with no hunting-down or typing-in of numbers).

## Will it explode?

No.

Please note that this _is_ currently **beta release** software - i.e. it may not work perfectly, _yet_.  It was released in Jan 2024 and is actively being developeed.

## Can I help?

Quite probably!

## Is this an official parkrun tool?

No.  This tool is not affiliated in any way with PARKRUN LIMITED who oversee parkrun events.
